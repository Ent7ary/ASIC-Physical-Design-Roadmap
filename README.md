# ASIC-Physical-Design-Roadmap
The journey of designing an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) is long and involves a number of major steps â€“ moving from a concept to specification to tape-outs. Although the end product is typically quite small (measured in nanometers), this long journey is interesting and filled with many engineering challenges.


Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) are application specific, which means the design is for sole purpose. So, the CPU inside your phone is ASIC. The digital circuitry of ASIC is made up of permanently connected gates and flip-flops in silicon. The logic function of ASIC is specified using hardware description languages such as Verilog, System Verilog or VHDL. ASIC is more power efficient than FPGAs, since its circuit is optimized for its specific function. Power consumption of ASICs can be very minutely controlled and optimized using many approaches such as Design Space Exploration DSE. ASIC is well suited for very high-volume mass production. ASIC are capable of working at much higher frequency than FPGAs. The important factor, ASICs can have complete analog circuitry, for example WiFi transceiver, on the same die along with microprocessor cores. This is the advantage which FPGAs lack. But as said, ASICs are not suited or preferred for the application areas where the design might need to be upgraded frequently or once-in-a-while. The verification is an absolutely importation step in ASIC prototyping as it is not recommended to prototype a design using ASICs unless it has been validated and verified. Thus, when the silicon has been taped out, almost nothing can be done to fix a design bug.

Thus, ASICs are better as mass production is possible, the cost per unit is lesser as compared to FPGA(whereas getting started with FPGA is cheaper as compared to ASIC). ASIC is comparatively energy efficient.The designer has few entry barriers to start with ASICs. Analog design can be implemented on ASIC.
