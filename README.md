# ASIC-Physical-Design-Roadmap
The journey of designing an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) is long and involves a number of major steps â€“ moving from a concept to specification to tape-outs. Although the end product is typically quite small (measured in nanometers), this long journey is interesting and filled with many engineering challenges.
